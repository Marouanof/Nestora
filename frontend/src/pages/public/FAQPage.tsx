          id: 'what-is-nestora',
          question: 'What is Nestora?',
          answer: 'Nestora is a blockchain-powered rental platform that connects property owners directly with tenants. Using smart contracts and cryptocurrency payments, we eliminate intermediaries, reduce fees, and provide secure, transparent transactions for everyone involved.'
        },
        {
          id: 'how-does-it-work',
          question: 'How does Nestora work?',
          answer: 'Property owners list their properties with detailed information and availability. Tenants can search, book, and pay securely using cryptocurrency. Smart contracts hold funds in escrow until the rental period is complete, ensuring both parties are protected.'
        },
        {
          id: 'blockchain-benefits',
          question: 'What are the benefits of blockchain technology?',
          answer: 'Blockchain provides immutable transaction records, eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, enables instant global payments, and ensures complete transparency and security for all rental agreements.'

        {
          id: 'funds-safe',
          question: 'Are my funds safe?',
          answer: 'Yes, all funds are held in smart contract escrow on the blockchain. Neither party can access the funds until the rental agreement conditions are met. This protects both owners and tenants from fraud.'

        {
          id: 'identity-verification',
          question: 'Do you verify identities?',
          answer: 'Property owners undergo identity verification and background checks. While tenant verification is optional, we recommend it for added security. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain for complete transparency.'
        },
        {
          id: 'dispute-resolution',
          question: 'What happens in case of disputes?',
          answer: 'Our smart contracts include dispute resolution mechanisms. In case of disagreements, funds can be held until both parties agree on a resolution, or released according to the contract terms. We also provide mediation services.'
        },
        {
          id: 'data-privacy',
          question: 'How do you protect my privacy?',

        },
        {
          id: 'payment-methods',
          question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
          answer: 'We accept various cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, USDC, and other stablecoins. This enables instant, low-fee international payments without currency conversion issues.'
        },
        {
          id: 'booking-cancellation',
          question: 'What is your cancellation policy?',
          answer: 'Cancellation policies vary by property owner. Most offer flexible cancellation up to 24-48 hours before check-in. Refunds are processed automatically through the smart contract once the policy conditions are met.'
        },
        {
          id: 'check-in-process',
          question: 'How does check-in work?',
          answer: 'Upon successful payment, you\'ll receive digital access credentials (smart lock codes, keys, etc.) through our secure messaging system. The smart contract automatically releases funds to the owner once you confirm successful check-in.'

          id: 'listing-fees',
          question: 'What are the fees for listing?',
          answer: 'Nestora charges no listing fees or commissions. You only pay a small blockchain network fee for transactions. This means you keep more of your rental income compared to traditional platforms.'

      questions: [
        {
          id: 'escrow-works',
          question: 'How does escrow work?',
          answer: 'When a booking is confirmed, tenant funds are locked in a smart contract. The funds remain inaccessible until the rental period completes successfully. This protects both parties from default or fraud.'
        },
        {
          id: 'funds-released',
          question: 'When are funds released?',
          answer: 'Funds are automatically released to the property owner upon tenant check-in confirmation. If issues arise during the stay, the smart contract can hold funds until resolution or release them according to the agreed terms.'
        },
        {
          id: 'crypto-wallet',
          question: 'Do I need a crypto wallet?',

          question: 'What are the technical requirements?',
